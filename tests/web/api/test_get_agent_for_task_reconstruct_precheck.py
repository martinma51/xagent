"""Regression test: ``get_agent_for_task`` skips reconstruct for fresh
RUNNING tasks but still runs it when prior state actually exists.

Background:
    ``begin_turn`` atomically flips a newly created SDK task's status
    to ``RUNNING`` before ``get_agent_for_task`` is called. A naive
    ``should_reconstruct = status in {RUNNING, PAUSED,
    WAITING_FOR_USER}`` test would route every brand-new SDK task
    into ``_reconstruct_agent_from_history``, which queries
    ``TraceEvent`` and ``DAGExecution.current_plan``, finds nothing,
    logs a misleading "Failed to reconstruct agent from history"
    warning, and falls through to normal creation. The full
    reconstruct path is 1-2s of wasted DB work plus a noisy log line
    that confuses incident triage.

    ``_has_reconstructable_history`` gates the reconstruct branch
    for ``RUNNING`` tasks: if neither a ``TraceEvent`` row nor a
    ``DAGExecution`` row exists for the task, the reconstruct branch
    is skipped and the function goes straight to normal creation.

    ``PAUSED`` / ``WAITING_FOR_USER`` tasks are NOT gated on the
    pre-check -- those states by definition have prior runtime state
    that must be recovered.

What this test pins:

    * RUNNING + empty history => reconstruct NOT called.
    * RUNNING + trace events present => reconstruct called (regression
      guard against accidentally widening the skip condition).
    * PAUSED => reconstruct called even with empty history (the pre-
      check intentionally doesn't gate non-RUNNING active statuses).
