"""Stable error schema for the ``/v1/*`` SDK surface.

Every error response on the SDK surface is shaped like:

    {
        "error": {
            "code": "<stable enum>",
            "message": "<human-readable, may change>"
        }
    }

The ``code`` is the contract SDK clients pin against; ``message`` is
free text that may be updated for clarity without breaking clients.

Why a separate error envelope from ``/api/*``:
    ``/api/*`` uses FastAPI's default ``{"detail": "..."}`` shape, which
    is fine for an in-house web UI but a poor SDK surface -- clients
    would have to string-match against ``detail`` to distinguish "wrong
    key" from "no such task" from "rate-limited". Coding the cause in a
    stable enum lets each SDK language map server errors to typed
    exceptions deterministically.
